# Request for grade

## Overview

Since we’ve been working on the same project all term I’d like you to write a rationale explaining why your pattern library perfectly represents an eCommerce website.

Explain how it fully encompasses all the possible components that are needed to make the whole website—even the pages that we didn’t make ourselves.

- Does it fully represent all the possible components & their variations?
- Does it fully explain everything to someone else?
- Could another person in class jump in and code a new page without asking you questions?
- Are there components that are missing or incomplete?

Give yourself a grade & explain to me **why** you deserve the grade you chose for yourself.

- Give yourself a grade for the project: F, C, B, A, A+
- Write an explanation as to why the pattern library is a perfect representation of the whole website.
- Be honest with yourself and with me (I’ll notice if you’re not)

**I will read your explanation while looking over your pattern library. If your feedback is honest and just, you will receive the mark you chose.**
